# Step by step Recipe for Chicken Pizza
* For making Chicken Tikka, marinate chicken with salt, Red chilli powder, Cumin powder, Garam Masala Powder, Curd, Kasoori Methi, Lime and Red color. Keep aside for 1 hour or more.
* Heat a pan and sprinkle some oil. Add chicken pieces and stir well.
* Cover and allow to slow roast on small flame till dry. Stir in between.
* Once all the chicken Tikka are roasted, drain and allow to cool.
* Cut into smaller pieces and keep aside.
* Mix the flour, milk powder, 1 tbsp sugar, baking powder and salt very well.
* In a cup add yeast, 1 tbsp sugar and half of the luke warm milk and mix well. Keep aside.
* Make a well in the center of flour and pour the yeast mix and gently combine.
* Add more lukewarm milk and water to make a smooth dough. Knead for some time. The dough will be sticky.
* Rub little olive oil or butter in your hands and pat the top of the dough, knead again till you can feel that the dough is smooth and soft.
* Cover nicely and keep for 1 -2 hours, till the dough is double the size.
* Meanwhile, cut the Capsicum (Bell Pepper), Onion, Tomatoes. Grate the cheese and keep aside.
* Once the Pizza dough becomes double in size, punch down and divide into two or three parts.
* Take one part and place on a parchment paper. With your palm gently press the dough starting from the centre to the sides to make a big round base of about ½ inch thickness (you can also dust and roll out with the help of Rolling Pin).
* Leave it covered to rise for 10 – 15 minutes.
* Make Pizza sauce by mixing Tomato sauce, olive oil, ginger garlic paste and oregano spice.
* Poke the Pizza base with a fork to release bubbles.
* Gently brush the sides with little butter (optional) and put Pizza sauce generously on top.
* Add little grated Cheddar cheese and top with chicken pieces, chopped onion, capsicum and Tomatoes.
* Cover with Mozzarella cheese and sprinkle oregano/ Pizza spice mix.
* Keep covered for 10 more minutes and transfer to a baking tin (with the parchment paper).
* Bake in a preheated oven at 180OC for 20 minutes or till the cheese melts and turn brown.
* Take out and cut into triangles with a Pizza cutter and enjoy the wonderful Chicken Tikka Pizza.
